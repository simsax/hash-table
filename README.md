# hash-table
Hash Table in C for personal usage.

I needed a simple hash table for one of my projects, so I experimented a bit and I extracted the 
code into its own repository. It's not a generic implementation because I don't care, I just wanted
something to copy-paste and adapt depending on what I need, because I'd rather not deal with void pointers.

It's based on [this](https://craftinginterpreters.com/hash-tables.html) implementation with some minor tweaks.
